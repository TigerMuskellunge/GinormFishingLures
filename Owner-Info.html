     His favorite fish is a Tiger Muskie. The reason is because they are so hard to catch, and when you do get one they fight very hard. He also like them because
     of there size as they can get to 50". He also like how they look, and he also like the reason they are in lake which is to reduce pan fish populations. A great
     example of this is Pineview where they have been put in there to kill the pan fish to control the population.
