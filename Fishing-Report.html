		 We went up on May 13, and caught 25 14-17 inch Rainbows. All of the fish were caught trolling
		 pop-gear and a worm. We tried some casting in the morning, and had a few bit and hook ups, but
		 we never landed any fish, and the bit was very slow casting. All in all we would say the fishing
		 is good to hot if you troll the proper stuff.
