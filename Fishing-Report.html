		 We went up on May 13, and caught 25 14-17 inch Rainbows. All of the fish were caught trolling
		 pop-gear and a worm. We tried some casting in the morning, and had a few bit and hook ups, but
		 we never landed any fish, and the bit was very slow casting. It also seemed to be, the further
		 south on the lake we went the less bites we got. We found the best places were on the west side
		 in around 50-70 feet of water. All in all we would say the fishing is good to hot if you troll
		 the proper stuff.
